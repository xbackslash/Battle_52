# Battle_52
A card game where you and the AI battle with 52 card decks of playing cards.

This is a barebones game made completely in pygame with the help of ChatGPT-3.5.

I did a lot of the setup and planning then I ran the code throught ChatGPT for changes and fixes.
It's still in the works but in its current state it is playable.
